      <h1>How class inequality is depicted in Bong Joon Ho’s Parasite</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
          Parasite became the first non-English language film in Academy Awards history to win Best Picture.
          The film ingeniously depicts inequality, poverty, and the gap between the rich and the poor through
          infrastructure, architecture, and comedic tropes that expose the hard results of South Korean capitalism.
        </p>
        <h2>Inspired from a true story</h2>
        <p>
          Loosely based on the Korean classic The Housemaid (1960) and the true crime story of Christine and Léa Papin,
          Parasite tells the story of the hustling Kim family, who slowly but surely manage to infiltrate the wealthy Park family home
          by conquering all their service jobs. The crabs-in-a-bucket mentality of modern society is personified by the Kims,
          who underhandedly work themselves in at the expense of everything and everyone.
        </p>
        <h2>A capitalist system satire</h2>
        <p>
          Bong doesn’t just portray the Kims as bad guys, however. If anything, Parasite is a critique of the capitalist system
          as a whole and pointing out that we’re all complicit in it. One where rich people live in villas on a hill,
          and poor people live in basements with sewer water. This man-made difference in life quality will benefit those on top of the hill,
          but only until it doesn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          This vertical divide in society is made literal in the film. The Kims descend down into Seoul’s lower parts to go home,
          which means, in the case of heavy rainstorms, they’re followed by streams of rainwater that flow straight into their basement apartment.
          The Parks on the opposite end, are entangled in the same rat race upwards in their cold modern house where everyone lives in opposite directions.
        </p>
        <h2>Some things don't change !</h2>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, in that same house, the titular character witnesses it all. What to make of that? Maybe the real value of life
          transcends matters of concrete or a rock. But maybe that’s too metaphorical. Five years after its premiere at Cannes Film Festival,
          it’s even clearer that Parasite will forever be relevant.
